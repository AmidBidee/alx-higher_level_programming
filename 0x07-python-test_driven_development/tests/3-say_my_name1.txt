Testing ``say_my_name``
-----------------------

The say_my_name function, prints two strings as <first_name> and <last_name>
in the format `` My name is <first_name> <last_name> ``

Import function:

        >>> say_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name

Usage:
	>>> say_name("Freeda", "Bells")
	My name is Freeda Bells
	
	>>> say_name("Bob")
	My name is Bob 

Only strings can be passed:	
	>>> try:
        ...     say_name(1, "Bells")
        ... except Exception as e:
        ...     print(e)
	first_name must be a string

	>>> try:
	...	say_name("Freeda", 1)
	... except Exception as e:
	... 	print(e)
	last_name must be a string

only enter first name and last name:
	
	>>> try:
        ...     say_name("Freeda", "Miles",  "Bells")
        ... except Exception as e:
        ...     print(e)
	say_my_name() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
